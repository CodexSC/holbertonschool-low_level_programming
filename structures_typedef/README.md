## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General
- What are structures, when, why and how to use them
- How to use `typedef`

## Requirements

### General
- **Allowed editors:** `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- **Compilation:** All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, with options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- **File format:** All files should end with a new line
- **README:** A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory
- **Code style:** Your code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`
- **Global variables:** Not allowed
- **Functions per file:** No more than 5 functions per file
- **Allowed library functions:** `printf`, `malloc`, `free`, and `exit` only
- **Main files:** The `main.c` files shown in examples are for testing only. They don't need to be pushed to your repo
- **Header files:** Don't forget to push your header file
- **Include guards:** All header files should be include guarded

## Project Overview

This project focuses on understanding and implementing C structures and the typedef keyword. You will learn how to organize data using structures and create type aliases to improve code readability and maintainability.

### Key Topics
- Structure definition and declaration
- Accessing structure members
- Pointers to structures
- The typedef keyword
- Structure initialization
- Memory allocation with structures

**Happy Coding! 🚀**
